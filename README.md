## Main Projects

### A Survey on Sensor Calibration in Air Pollution Monitoring Deployments 
In this article, we review the state-of-the-art low-cost air pollution sensors, identify their major error sources, and comprehensively survey calibration
models as well as network re-calibration strategies suited for different sensor deployments.
